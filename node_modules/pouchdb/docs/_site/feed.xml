        <title>Taming the asynchronous beast with ES7</title>
        
          <dc:creator>Nolan Lawson</dc:creator>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the trickiest aspects of PouchDB is that the API is asynchronous. I see no shortage of confused questions on Stack Overflow, Github, and IRC, and most often they stem from a misunderstanding of callbacks and promises.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Efficiently managing UI state with PouchDB</title>
        
          <dc:creator>Nolan Lawson</dc:creator>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A common pattern in data-driven apps is to display the entire database in the UI. If you&amp;#39;re using PouchDB, that means you want to mirror the contents of PouchDB to some in-memory representation used by the UI.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;A new month means a new PouchDB release. Over the last month we have been looking around the rough edges and cleaning things up or chopping them off along with the usual slew of bugfixes and a lot of great news.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;A humble release to ring in the new year, PouchDB 3.2.1 is focused on bugfixes and performance improvements. In particular, 3.2.1 boasts some critical fixes for IE11 and node-webkit, as well as a fix for replication of conflicted documents.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Pains Of Being Async At Heart</title>
        
          <dc:creator>Dale Harvey</dc:creator>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are testing JavaScript you will likely have to test against async API&amp;#39;s. These bring up some issues that you may not be familiar with if you are used to testing synchronous code. Here are a few things I have learnt working on the PouchDB test suite.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How we test PouchDB</title>
        
          <dc:creator>Dale Harvey</dc:creator>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;While working on and researching improvements for automated testing in PouchDB, I found a lack of blog posts and general information about how open-source libraries test themselves. With PouchDB, a huge amount of effort has gone into testing, but we haven&amp;#39;t talked about it much outside the project. So I wanted to explain a little about our approach.&lt;/p&gt;
